## Description

Horiseon Social Services, Inc. marketing agency wants to update their codebase to ensure it follows accessibility standards. This will enhance the website to be more compatible for people with disabilities while also improving the codebase for long-term sustainability. 

- With the world shifting to a larger online presence, it is important to adapt to stay relevant. As someone that uses TTS Reader daily, it makes a huge difference when pages are properly laid out and have relevant annotations   
- Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google
- Best practice is to leave something better than you found it. With that said, cleaning up the CSS document will help the website run a little cleaner and make it easier for a future developer to understand what is happening. 
- I learned that the README is the most important document of a project and that it is always better to include more information than not enough

## Usage

I cleaned up the CSS file and created comments to make the document easier to follow for any developer that follows me. I made adjustments based on the acceptance criteria: 

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
